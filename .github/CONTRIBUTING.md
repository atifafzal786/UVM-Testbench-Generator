## Contributing to UVM-Testbench-Generator

Thanks for your interest! Quick guidelines:

- Fork and create a branch per feature/fix: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests where possible.
- Run the app locally and verify generated files are syntactically valid SystemVerilog.
- Open a pull request against `main` and reference any related issues.

For large feature requests, please open an issue first to discuss design and scope.
